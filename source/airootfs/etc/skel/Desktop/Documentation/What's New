Arch Linux Midfingr Edition

ISO refresh May 2016

- lightdm replaces lxdm (login manager) + settings manager to customize the login screen
- volumeicon replaces volwheel
- included the package networkmanager-dispatcher-ntpd; sync time to your location up startup
- new feature: enable/disable compton; may help with screen tearing
- removed the pacman-init service (adds 3+ seconds to boot time), thus PACMAN NOT WORKING steps are necessary
