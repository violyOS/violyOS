EDIT for your country:
sudo reflector -c 'Your Country' -f 6 -l 6 -p http -n 12 --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

You can also run localepurge with the command lcp and lcc:

###DANGER##
The following command will remove all open source video drivers and you will need to install them again:

sudo pacman -Rs $(pacman -Qq | grep \^xf86-video-)

The reason for this is to clean up extra disk space used for unneeded xorg-drivers ; virtualbox is NOT affected by the command.

### Please Note ###
Installation on a system requires you remove the virtualbox guest utilities, disable the service and remove the module. Do to so, proceed with the following:

sudo pacman -Rns virtualbox-guest-utils
sudo pacman -Rns virtualbox-guest-modules-arch
(if present):
sudo rm /etc/modules-load.d/virtualbox.conf

reboot to make sure the module is cleared
